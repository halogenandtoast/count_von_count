h1. Count Von Count

h2. Installation

<code>
script/plugin install git://github.com/toastyapps/count_von_count.git<br />
script/generate count_migration<br />
rake db:migrate<br />
</code>

h2. Usage

From inside your controller action you may now do
<code>
	@post = Post.find(params[:id])<br />
	@post.update_view_count(request)<br />
</code>

You also get a view_count helper method
<code>@post.view_count # 10</code>

If you want to store the total view count on the model add a field called "total_view_count" to your model

You may also add IP addresses to a blacklist so that they are not recorded by adding this to an initializer
<code>CountVonCount.blacklist = %w{127.0.0.1}</code>
