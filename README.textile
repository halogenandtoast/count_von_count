h1. Count Von Count

h2. Installation

@script/plugin install git://github.com/toastyapps/count_von_count.git@
@script/generate count_migration@
@rake db:migrate@

h2. Usage

From inside your controller action you may now do
@
	@post = Post.find(params[:id])
	@post.update_view_count(request)
@
You also get a view_count helper method
@@post.view_count # 10@

If you want to store the total view count on the model add a field called "total_view_count" to your model

You may also add IP addresses to a blacklist so that they are not recorded by adding this to an initializer
@CountVonCount.blacklist = %w{127.0.0.1}@
